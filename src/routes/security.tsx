Sessions use short-lived access credentials and rotating refresh tokens, with sensitive authentication material protected from client-side storage." },

Capabilities are enforced centrally through shared authorization controls rather than scattered application-level checks." },

Scoring infrastructure accesses answer keys through controlled internal paths, while learner-facing endpoints expose only the data required to conduct the investigation." },

          ThreatLens is designed for security investigation training using
          synthetic telemetry rather than real customer security data. The
          platform architecture follows the same principles of isolation,
          access control, data protection, and operational security
          expected from modern enterprise software.

          Secrets are kept outside the source repository and rotated when
          exposure is suspected. Data in transit is protected using TLS,
          while sensitive configuration data receives additional protection
          at rest. Requests are validated at application boundaries, and
          dependencies are continuously monitored for known security
          vulnerabilities.
